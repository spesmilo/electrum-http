      <p>This is a sample web interface that lets you create on-chain
	and lightning invoices to your Electrum wallet. You can use it
	with an electrum daemon running on a webserver. The lightning
	invoice will be replaced by an error message if your wallet is
	disconnected or does not have enough inbound liquidity to
	receive the requested amount. The on-chain invoice will not be
	displayed if the amount is too small to be received onchain.
